# BigBoyEngine
 A 2D game framework based off the Godot Engine, built with MonoGame.
 Please keep in mind this is mainly for me to work on my games, but if other people can figure out how to use (contact me if you want) then I hope it benefits them too.
 This engine does not cover all cases, and was just to help me make my games quicker and unify all my code.
